% t_CreateManyConeAbsorptionSignalNoiseDatasets
% Create multiple datasets consisting of the cone absorption of signals
% with and without added noise
%
% Description:
%    This tutorial creates a dataset for each of the contrast values in
%    "contrastValues". The resulting dataset consists of a signal, whose strength is 
%    defined by "contrast". The signal consists of stripes that can be seen
%    with a frequency of "frequency" on the generated image. In addition to
%    the signal, there is noise added as well. 
%    This image is then processed by a cone absorption function that 
%    simulates the stimulus generated, would this signal/noise image be 
%    absorbed by eye cones. The resulting image is then center cropped from
%    a size of 249x249 to a size of 227x227. This does not affect the 
%    created signal pattern itself, as it is pretty much only visible
%    within the cropped 227x227 center. 
%
%    "numSamples" images with noise are generated for each frequency, as
%    well as "numSamples" of images with noise only (-> no signal). For
%    each of these "numSamples" images, two addtitional images are created,
%    each consisting of a mean image (only signal, no noise).  {Why two
%    when one is enough? - Just for the user to verify that different runs
%    create the same no noise image. Also, to preserve the dimensional
%    structure.}
